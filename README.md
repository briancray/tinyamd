#tinyamd

Teeny tiny AMD implementation

##Why use tinyamd?

Because you like things that come in small packages.

##Why use a different AMD framework?

Because you need to support CommonJS or you run your app outside of the browser.

##Does it work?
Heck yea. Try messing out with the files in `/tests/`
